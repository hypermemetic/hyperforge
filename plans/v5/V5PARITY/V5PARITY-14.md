## Problem

V5PARITY-3 gave workspaces the four "transport" verbs (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push_all`). Daily use exposes three gaps:

1. The `pull` / `push_all` asymmetry is a v4 holdover; symmetric `pull` / `push` reads cleaner.
2. There's no way to inspect or coordinate state across members without dropping to per-repo calls. `status` (audit), `checkout` (switch a feature branch everywhere), `commit` (sync a uniform edit), and `tag` (release coordination) all show up in workspace-wide flows.
3. The private `git_op(name, "clone")` dispatch on a string discriminant — added in V5PARITY-3 to share the iteration loop — has the iteration shape right but expresses dispatch as `match op { "clone" => ..., "fetch" => ..., ... }`. Stringly-typed and the type system isn't pulling its weight. Adding 4 more verbs would grow that switch to 8 entries; right time to refactor.

## Required behavior

**RPC methods on WorkspacesHub:**

| Method | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `workspaces.push --name W [--remote R] [--branch B]` | Replaces `push_all`. Same semantics; symmetrical naming with `pull`. `push_all` is removed (no alias — clean break, this surface is new and v4-only callers are migrating anyway). |
| `workspaces.status --name W` | Per-member `status_snapshot { ref, branch, ahead, behind, dirty, staged, unstaged, untracked }`; aggregate `workspace_status_summary { total, dirty, ahead, behind }`. Read-only. |
| `workspaces.checkout --name W --branch B [--create bool]` | Switch every member to branch `B`. With `--create true`, creates the branch if it doesn't exist locally. Per-member `member_git_result`; aggregate `workspace_git_summary` (existing shape from V5PARITY-3). |
| `workspaces.commit --name W --message M [--allow_empty bool] [--only_dirty bool]` | Run `git commit -m M` in every member. `--only_dirty true` (default) skips members with no staged changes; `--allow_empty true` overrides for ceremonial commits. |
| `workspaces.tag --name W --tag T [--message M]` | Apply tag `T` across every member. Annotated when `--message` is given; lightweight otherwise. |

**Dispatch refactor.** Drop the `git_op(name, "clone")` string-dispatch helper. The shared part — load workspace yaml, decode each `WorkspaceRepo` into a member context, emit summary at end — is real shared code and stays as small typed helpers (e.g. a `member_ctxs(ws, loaded, ws_path) -> impl Iterator<Item = MemberCtx>` free function). The per-verb logic is NOT shared and lives directly in each method, calling `ops::git::*` with the right arguments and yielding the right events. Each public method reads top-to-bottom; no central match statement.

The event vocabulary stays: `MemberGitResult { ref, op, status, message? }` and `WorkspaceGitSummary { name, op, total, ok, errored }` are emitted by clone/fetch/pull/push/checkout/commit/tag. `status` adds two new variants — `StatusSnapshot` (per-member) and `WorkspaceStatusSummary` (aggregate counts of dirty/ahead/behind) — because a generic ok/errored loses too much info for the audit use case.

**Sequential v1.** Iteration stays sequential (matches V5PARITY-3 scope). Bounded parallelism is a separate concern — it was deferred in V5PARITY-3 and the deferral doesn't have its own ticket yet; leave the parallelism gap for a follow-up.

## What must NOT change

- V5PARITY-3's `repos.{clone,fetch,pull,push_refs,status,dirty}` per-repo methods stay byte-identical.
- V5PARITY-12's `command-git` DRY invariant — every git call goes through `ops::git::*` wrappers.
- Bounded parallelism + partial-failure-tolerance pattern (D6).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `workspaces.push --name W` succeeds against a workspace with 2+ members; `push_all` is no longer accepted (returns "command not found").
2. `workspaces.status --name W` on a workspace with one dirty member emits `status_snapshot` per member and a `workspace_status_summary { dirty: 1, ... }` aggregate.
3. `workspaces.checkout --name W --branch feat-x --create true` creates and switches to `feat-x` across every member; second invocation is a no-op (already on the branch).
4. `workspaces.commit --name W --message "uniform"` after staging the same edit in two members produces two commits; with `--only_dirty true` (default), members with no staged changes are skipped (status: `skipped`, not `errored`).
5. `workspaces.tag --name W --tag v0.1.0` applies the tag to every member; failures on individual members surface as `errored` status without aborting the run.
6. `grep -RE 'fn git_op|match op {|"clone" =>' src/v5/workspaces.rs` returns zero hits (the string-dispatch helper is gone).

## Completion

- Run `bash tests/v5/V5PARITY/V5PARITY-14.sh` → exit 0 (tier 1; uses local bare repos).
- Ready → Complete in-commit.
