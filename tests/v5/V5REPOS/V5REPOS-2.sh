# V5REPOS-2: pin the ForgePort capability via schema introspection.
# The wire-level check is that the capability surface declares exactly
# the four DriftFieldKind fields as its metadata shape. Implementation
# may expose this via schema introspection, diagnostics, or an
# integration test of an adapter's output. This script exercises the
# schema path; the adapter scripts (V5REPOS-9/10/11) cover the live-API
# shape check.
